## TEXT 1 
 For the beginning we are given easy crypto stuff : - 
 **CRYPTO** 
 	   `131017171A48221A1D170F` 
 	     and we are given an input field now by using that field  we can find that
 	     *a = 0c 
 	     b= 0d* 
 	     and so on ...
 	     so we find the      the whole character set  [0-9 a-z A-Z - _ . , ; : ? ! [space]] 
and we that to decode the *crypto*
